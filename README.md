# My personal neovim config

This repository is meant for personal use, but feel free to take inspiration from it or use it.

It is based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/tree/master),
but split into multiple files, with some extra plugins and some removed.

## Add Language Support

- [Enable parsing](./lua/plugins/treesitter.lua)
- [Add a suitable LSP](./lua/plugins/lsp-config.lua)
